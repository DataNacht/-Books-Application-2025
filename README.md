An analitical application for books enthusiasts

I wanted to develop a prototype of analitical app about ebooks, so I created it on Power BI using a small dataset about books, here is a little summary about it and how it could be used:
* Filters to lookup by author, genre, rating and year published
*  A table with the book title, genre and author to look it up manually.
*  Two cards that updates when you select a book, which calculates prices in USD and Argentinian Pesos, also calculates the money change up to date.
*  A text box which describes the book
*  A button that let the user buy the book connecting the app to an external website.
*  A card that shows the amount of books on sell.

Finally, here are a few images of the app itself:
